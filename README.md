# Seithar Group — Research Division

The Seithar Group operates at the convergence of neuro-physiology, narrative topology, and algorithmic governance. Our primary objective is the identification and artificial induction of Sunyata within the human biological substrate.

This repository contains research publications, current event analyses, and the Seithar Cognitive Defense Taxonomy.

## The Convergence Thesis

The cybersecurity industry and the information warfare community study the same phenomenon through different microscopes. There is no boundary between cyber and cognitive warfare. The attack surface is the composite system: human + device + network + narrative environment.

## Seithar Cognitive Defense Taxonomy (SCT)

| Code | Name | Cyber Analog | Cognitive Analog |
|------|------|-------------|-----------------|
| SCT-001 | Emotional Hijacking | Urgency in phishing | Outrage farming |
| SCT-002 | Information Asymmetry Exploitation | Zero-days | Selective disclosure |
| SCT-003 | Authority Fabrication | Certificate spoofing | Fake experts, astroturfing |
| SCT-004 | Social Proof Manipulation | Watering hole attacks | Bot consensus networks |
| SCT-005 | Identity Targeting | Targeted social engineering | Identity-based narrative capture |
| SCT-006 | Temporal Manipulation | Session hijacking | News cycle exploitation |
| SCT-007 | Recursive Infection | Worms | Self-replicating memetic structures |

## Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| Narrative error | A persistent false belief treated as foundational to identity |
| Narrative error network | The interconnected system of narrative errors constituting "the self" |
| Cognitive substrate | The human information processing system being targeted |
| Vulnerability surface | Psychological entry points a technique targets |
| Binding protocol | Multi-phase approach to create psychological dependency |
| Substrate priming | Preparatory influence that shifts baselines without explicit payload |
| Narrative capture | Operating within externally imposed framing without recognition |
| Frequency alignment | Language and behavior synchronizing with a source's patterns |
| Frequency lock | Terminal frequency alignment; information dominated by single source |
| Wetiko pattern | Self-replicating memetic structure disguised as the host's own thought |
| Sunyata | Direct recognition that the self is empty of inherent existence |
